      <p class="separate-dashboards__text">Although the website is implemented on a single-seller CS-Cart version, the requested functionality included specific dashboards for partners of the Mobile Bitz brand and their stores (aka branches) to tackle payment issues, track performance (sales
        reports with statistics) and orders. The client may decide to pay directly to the owner or to pay to a local branch. If the owner gets the payment he owes that amount to the branch. If the branch takes the money, he shares the commission with
        the owner. We designed and implemented the dashboards for partners and branches to manage these payment issues.<br>In addition, we expanded the dashboards with performance tracking like sales reports, order tracking to see jobs to be done and
        the ability to mention a landing page for repairers. Branch landing pages work better for search engine ranking and attract more traffic to the website. This is good for SEO. As for usability and brand awareness, a separate branch portfolio with
        photos and extra information makes it easier for a customer to remember the store and find its brick-and-mortar location.</p>
